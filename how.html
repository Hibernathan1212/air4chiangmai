								<h3>Raising Awareness</h3>
								<p>We are committed to spreading the word about the importance of clean air and the urgent need for action. By educating the public about the harmful effects of air pollution on health, the environment, and the economy, we aim to build a strong, informed community of supporters who are ready to advocate for and contribute to meaningful change. Through online campaigns, events, and partnerships, we strive to amplify this message and inspire collective action.</p>
                                <h3>Donations</h3>
								<p>One of the most direct ways you can make a difference is by donating to our cause. Your contributions fuel our initiatives and help us take tangible steps toward improving air quality in Chiang Mai. Additionally, sharing this page and spreading our message can bring more people into the movement, multiplying our impact.</p>
								<h3>How We Allocate Donations</h3>
								<ul>
									<li><b> Development and Distribution of Solutions (40%)</b><br>A significant portion of donations will go toward creating and distributing air purifiers, air quality sensors, and positive pressure systems to protect vulnerable populations. These tools provide immediate relief, especially during high-pollution seasons, by giving families and communities access to cleaner indoor air.
                                    </li> <br>
									<li><b>Research and Understanding (40%)</b><br>Tackling air pollution requires a deep understanding of its sources, impacts, and the most effective interventions. We fund scientific studies, data collection, and community-driven research projects to build a comprehensive knowledge base about air pollution in Chiang Mai. This research will guide policies, identify hotspots, and drive evidence-based solutions that address the root causes of pollution.<br>
                                    </li> <br>
									<li><b>Support for Like-Minded Non-Profits (20%)</b><br>Collaboration is key to creating lasting change. We dedicate part of our resources to supporting other non-profits and organizations that share our mission of improving air quality in Chiang Mai. By working together and leveraging our collective strengths, we can achieve greater impact than any one group could alone. 
                                    </li>
								</ul>
                                <h3>Collaboration</h3>
                                <p>We believe that solving the air pollution crisis requires collective effort, which is why collaboration is a crucial part of our organization. By wokring with other organizations and institutions, we can pool resources, share knowledge, and amplify our impact across Chiang Mai and beyond.</p>
                                <h4>Collaboration with Academic Institutions</h4>
                                <p>We are proud to work with leading research groups at Chiang Mai University and Chiang Rajabhat University to deepen our understanding of the causes and consequences of air pollution. These partnerships enable us to: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Conduct cutting-edge research on pollution sources, health impacts, and mitigation strategies</li>
                                    <li>Develop innovative solutions, such as air quality monitoring systems and sustainable technologies</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Relief efforts</h4>
                                <p>During high-pollution seasons, we collaborate with relief organizations based in Chiang Mai University and Chiang Rajabhat University to provide immediate assistance to those most affected. These efforts include distributing air purifiers, masks, and educational materials to help families and communities reduce their exposure to harmful pollutants. By leveraging the networks and resources of these institutions, we can reach more people in need and deliver targeted support where it’s needed most.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Partnering with Other Non-Profits</h4>
                                <p>We actively collaborate with like-minded non-profit organizations that are also dedicated to improving air quality in Chiang Mai. By sharing strategies, resources, and best practices, we ensure that our combined efforts are as effective and far-reaching as possible. Whether it’s co-hosting events, coordinating advocacy campaigns, or aligning our goals, working together allows us to create a unified front against air pollution.
